Shrikara Murthy is an accomplished Design Verification (DV) Engineer, currently working at Groq in Austin, TX, where he focuses on block and system-level verification. He graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering in May 2019. During his time at university, he was part of the Honors Electrical and Computer Engineering program, the Jefferson Scholar Program, and UTeach, achieving a GPA of 3.0. Shrikara excelled academically, scoring a 35 on the ACT and a 1580 on the SAT.
Shrikara's professional journey began with internships that laid a solid foundation for his expertise in network engineering and security. He worked as a Network Security Deployment Intern at Red River in Spring 2019, where he configured, installed, and troubleshooted routers, switches, firewalls, unified communications, and wireless devices. He ensured the implementation of security protocols across network platforms within deployments and datacenters and developed network and voice configuration documentation for customers. His previous internships include his role as a Network Engineering and Installations Intern at Apogee Telecom in Austin, TX, during the summers of 2017 and 2018. In this role, Shrikara configured and installed networking switches and access points at over 20 college campuses across the U.S., managed inventory, tagged assets, and designed a cost-effective component in AutoCAD, which was 50% cheaper than the previous component. He also analyzed over 1,000 support tickets to identify frequent problems and presented his findings to management.
After completing his degree, Shrikara joined NXP Semiconductor in July 2019 as a SoC Design Verification Engineer, where he created and executed a DMA verification plan and global DMA verification strategy for a multicore low-power NPI SoC. His responsibilities included ensuring coverage goals were met, running and debugging RTL, UPF, and GLS simulations, and supporting validation and team members. Shrikara performed IP Level Verification on various IPs using UVM testbenches, SystemVerilog, and Python scripts, and verified the MIPI-CSI subsystem for an asynchronous ring-based NPI SoC using a third-party VIP and C stimulus in a UVM testbench. Additionally, he created and performed level 1 validation for six digital and analog IPs for an NPI SoC in both emulation and silicon. His technical competency and initiative were recognized, leading to his promotion for taking on critical unassigned IPs.
In June 2021, Shrikara joined Intel as an IP & Subsystem Design Verification Engineer and Verification Lead. At Intel, he developed OVM sequences to test MBOX at the IP level with IDI and Interrupt BFMs and at the subsystem level with E-Cores. He expanded verification infrastructure support from 2 CPU to 8 CPU and modified checkers to support the integration of new IPs. Shrikara also brainstormed, developed, and debugged coverage in SystemVerilog to ensure verification completeness, and mentored other verification team members while supporting the SoC team with debugging as the MBOX team’s Verification Lead
In November 2021, Shrikara transitioned to Meta as a Graphics IP Verification Engineer. In this role, he developed and executed verification test plans for a low-power 2D GPU using UVM methodology. His work involved mentoring and guiding contract engineers on verification methodology, code quality, and IP architecture/behavior. Shrikara wrote a Unit Level Testbench (ULT) generation script that significantly accelerated ULT bring-up and onboarding, created tests, monitored regressions, wrote coverage, and owned DV for the Control, Integration, and Shader block ULTs. He implemented and owned the CVB, INTG, and SHD blocks in the C++ Reference Model used for verification and performance testing, contributed to the development of a constrained random stimulus generator in SystemVerilog for both top and block-level testing, and modified an existing C++ SVG parser and driver to enable testing of SVG images for both the RTL and Reference Model.
In addition to his professional experience, Shrikara has been involved in various class projects during his time at university. These include simulating and emulating memory-centric architecture for his Senior Design Capstone project, writing a real-time operating system on a TI microcontroller to control an autonomous robot car, and creating a chat server/client in Java that incorporated MongoDB and JavaFX. He also designed, milled, soldered, and programmed a smart clock to retrieve news, sports, and weather data, wrote an assembler and cycle-accurate architecture simulator for a 16-instruction ISA in C, created a distributed word frequency histogram generator using Java and Hadoop, and developed a job satisfaction predictor using XGBoost and Lasso models in Python. Furthermore, Shrikara coded basic data structures such as binary trees, hash maps, linked lists, and various graphs in Java and C.
Outside of his class projects, Shrikara has also worked on several personal projects. He created a smart mirror using Raspberry Pi, an LCD monitor, and Python to display traffic and weather information. He developed an Android app for a local temple to manage transactions, accounts, and send receipts. Additionally, he created a Firefox add-on in JavaScript to identify and rename click-bait links, and helped create a drivable couch using a microcontroller, motors, motor drivers, and a PlayStation controller.
Shrikara's leadership experience and activities are extensive. He earned the rank of Eagle Scout by planning and building a 2000+ sq. ft. outdoor garden and classroom, raising over $10,000 and coordinating 30+ people for over 950 man-hours of labor. As an undergraduate teaching assistant for an upper-division Java programming class, he was responsible for creating and grading assignments and tests, leading recitation sections, and assisting students. As the treasurer of the Hindu Students Association, Shrikara managed over $30,000 annually and planned events attended by over 3,000 people. He also mentored a winning team at the UT Robotathon, contributed over 1,500 hours to volunteer work at a temple, and was actively involved in Kiwanis, where he planned activities and raised $3,000 for a well in Sierra Leone. Additionally, he tutored two gifted children, trained them for UIL Academic competitions and SAT/ACT exams, and taught them the basics of WordPress, Scratch, and Java.
Shrikara's honors include 1st place at the UT Robotathon in 2015, where he designed, built, and programmed an autonomous robot. He was a state qualifier in UIL Math and Number Sense, and placed 9th individually in UIL Computer Science, contributing to his team’s 4th place finish at the state level. He was awarded the T.J. Whaley Cockrell Engineering Honors Scholarship ($40,000) and the Nelda C. and H.J. Stark Foundation TILF Scholarship ($15,200)
